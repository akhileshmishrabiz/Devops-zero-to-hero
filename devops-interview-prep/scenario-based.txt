Scenario based devops interview questions 
Scenario: You are managing a high-traffic web application hosted on AWS. Recently, you've noticed intermittent performance issues during peak hours, resulting in increased latency and occasional downtime. How would you diagnose and address this issue?

Scenario: Your company is planning to migrate its on-premises data center to AWS. As part of the migration strategy, you need to ensure minimal downtime and data loss. How would you plan and execute the migration process?

Scenario: You are responsible for securing an AWS infrastructure hosting sensitive customer data. How would you design and implement a robust security strategy to protect against data breaches and unauthorized access?

Scenario: Your application relies heavily on AWS Lambda functions for processing incoming requests. Recently, you've observed a significant increase in execution times and occasional timeouts. How would you optimize the performance of Lambda functions to mitigate these issues?

Scenario: Your organization is experiencing exponential growth in data volume, leading to increased storage costs on AWS. How would you design a cost-effective storage solution that balances performance, scalability, and cost efficiency?

Scenario: You are tasked with designing a highly available and fault-tolerant architecture for a critical application on AWS. How would you leverage AWS services such as Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, and Multi-AZ deployments to achieve high availability and resilience?

Scenario: Your development team is adopting a microservices architecture for a new project on AWS. How would you design a scalable and resilient infrastructure to support microservices deployment, communication, and monitoring?
Scenario: Your company operates globally and needs to ensure low-latency access to its web application for users in different geographic regions. How would you architect a distributed application infrastructure using AWS services like Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Route 53, and AWS Global Accelerator to optimize performance and reduce latency?

Scenario: You are tasked with implementing disaster recovery (DR) capabilities for critical applications hosted on AWS. How would you design and configure a DR solution that provides rapid recovery, data integrity, and minimal downtime in the event of a disaster?

Scenario: Your organization is planning to deploy a containerized application on AWS using Amazon ECS. How would you design the architecture and infrastructure to orchestrate and manage containers effectively, ensuring scalability, availability, and performance?

Behavioural round Devops question
5 such interview questions I wish I had known before taking the actual DevOps Engineer Interview: 

1) Describe a time when you had to work closely with development teams to achieve a common goal. How did you ensure smooth collaboration?

If you are not prepared before, you might take time to think and sometimes be too late! 

Way to handle this: highlight your communication skills, collaboration tools (Slack, Jira), and specific instances where your role as a ‘glue person’ facilitated successful outcomes

2) What would you do if asked to take on a problem where you did not have the technical skills?

Mention HOW would you leverage available resources, seek expert help, quickly upskill, and transparently communicate progress to effectively address the problem


3) Tell me about the most challenging technical problem you have solved?

I would suggest preparing such cases before as time is less in the interview, 
e.g like How you resolved a complex multi-region database synchronization issue, ensuring data consistency and minimal downtime by implementing a robust replication and failover strategy.

or "like how you already have prepared a web application + infra as code project which can easy input via a web page and based on a single click create entire infrastructure in Cloud "

4) Tell me about a time you disagreed with a fellow engineer and how that issue was resolved.

It's a tricky question to find out how logical you are! 

here's an example of how to handle this: "I had resolved a disagreement over deployment strategies with a fellow engineer by facilitating a data-driven discussion, resulting in the adoption of a hybrid approach that improved efficiency and reliability"

5) If you had to pick between owning the entire process for one product versus contributing to multiple products at once, how would you decide?

It's a tricky cultural fit question, you can answer it like this:
"I would choose based on the potential for impact and learning, selecting the option that aligns best with my career goals and the organization’s strategic priorities."
